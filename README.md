# Login-page
There are two pages.
A. The sign-up page and
b. The sign-in page

The sign-up page
-If any field is left unfilled, it gives an error pop up.
-If the password and confirm password don't match, it gives an error pop up.
-If all fields are filled out correctly, it gives a success pop-up and then leads to the sign-in page.

B. The sign-in page
I saved the details of the user from the sign-up page in the localStorage.
-If the user doesn't provide the saved details, it gives an error pop-up.
-If a user gives the correct information, it grants access.
Following that, I set it to clear the storage after access is granted. For the user to gain access again, they need to sign up again.

Thank you for reading.
